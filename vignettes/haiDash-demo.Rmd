Introduction

The haiDash package provides tools and an interactive Shiny dashboard to explore Healthcare-Associated Infection (HAI) data.

This vignette demonstrates the basic workflow: loading the data, summarising infection counts, and running the dashboard.


1. Load the data

The package includes a cleaned dataset called hai_clean:

data("hai_clean")
head(hai_clean)


2. Summarise infection counts

Use the helper function summarise_hai() to compute case totals and their relative shares by infection type:

summary_tbl <- summarise_hai(hai_clean)
summary_tbl

You can also visualise the results quickly:

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(summary_tbl, aes(x = infection, y = share)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of infection types",
       y = "Share", x = "Infection Type") +
  theme_minimal()

3. Launch the Shiny app

Run the interactive dashboard included in the package:

run_app()

This app allows users to filter and explore infection data dynamically.

Conclusion

The haiDash package makes it easy to summarise and visualise infection data, and provides a Shiny interface for deeper exploration.
